                <p><em>Bologna, October 4th, 2024</em> – What a way to start the season! The Bologna Towers thrilled fans with a <strong>88-75</strong> victory against the Florence Eagles in their first home game of the season. Bologna’s own Marco Ferri, the team's sharp captain, was an unstoppable force, putting up <strong>28 points</strong>, along with <strong>10 assists</strong> and <strong>7 rebounds</strong>.<br>
                The energy inside the arena was electric from tip-off. American center <strong>James "Big Red" Walker</strong>, known for his aggressive style, really made his mark, adding <strong>15 points</strong> and <strong>12 rebounds</strong> and making it nearly impossible for Florence to get through the Towers’ defense.<br>
                Coach Matteo Rossi seemed pleased with the performance, noting, “Starting like this sets the tone for the season. The guys worked hard and played as a team.” The Towers will be looking to keep up the momentum as they head to Naples for their next game against the Scorpions.</p>

                <summary><strong>Bologna Towers Stumble Against Turin Falcons in Tough Road Match</strong></summary>
                <p><em>Turin, October 25th, 2024</em> – The Bologna Towers faced a challenging evening as they fell to the Turin Falcons, losing <strong>94-81</strong> in a game that tested their resilience. Despite a strong start, the Towers struggled to keep up with Turin's high-energy pace, especially in the second half.<br>
                The team’s usual playmakers had moments of brilliance, but consistency was an issue. <strong>Marco Ferri</strong>, the Towers’ captain, scored <strong>20 points</strong> and added <strong>5 assists</strong>, but was closely guarded by Turin’s defense, which limited his chances. Newcomer <strong>James Walker</strong> managed <strong>14 points</strong> and <strong>11 rebounds</strong>, but the Falcons’ big man <strong>Lorenzo Parisi</strong> outmatched him, leading all scorers with <strong>26 points</strong>.<br>
                Coach Matteo Rossi reflected after the game, saying, “It’s always tough to lose, but games like these teach us a lot. We’ll work on our defense and find ways to respond better when teams put pressure on us.” The Towers will have a chance to bounce back next week when they return to the PalaBologna Arena for a home game against the Venice Titans. Fans and players alike will be looking for a strong comeback.</p>
